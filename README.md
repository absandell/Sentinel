Sentinel is a website that has compiled data from a number of academic sources to visualize an interactive heatmap of the globe. This allows the user to interact with global issues in a way they never have before.

The site was created with the goal of creating a call to action in users, while providing them the resources and tools they need to incite positive change on a international scale. 

The site uses HTML5, CSS, Javascript, and DataMaps.io (http://datamaps.github.io/) an extension on D3.js. 

This project was created as a part of SwampHacks 2021.
